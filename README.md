# ðŸ”Ž JSON Table Visualizer

<b>JSON Table Visualizer</b> is a responsive, single-page application that converts JSON strings containing table headers and row values into plain text tables. Supports single & multi-table data, and dynamically checks for input/formatting errors as you type. Built with HTML, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/).
