# JSON Table Visualizer

Visualizes a table given as a JSON string containing its headers and values. Built for Leetcode's SQL problems.

Multi-table support coming soon. :)



Example:
```
{"headers": ["A", "B"], "values": [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]}
```
Output:
```
+---+---+
| A | B |
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 6 |
+---+---+
```
